# Welcome to My Blog

Hello and welcome to my personal blog! This is a simple blog website built from scratch using vanilla JavaScript and the marked.esm.js library for Markdown rendering.

## About This Blog

This blog demonstrates:

- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No frameworks or libraries except for Markdown parsing
- **Markdown Support**: All posts are written in Markdown format
- **Clean Design**: Simple, responsive design that works on all devices
- **Static Files**: All content is served as static files

## How This Blog Was Built Using GitHub Copilot
Building this blog was an enjoyable and efficient process, thanks to the help of GitHub Copilot. 
Copilot is an AI-powered coding assistant that suggests code and entire functions in real-time, 
directly within your editor. By leveraging Copilot, I was able to speed up development, reduce 
boilerplate, and focus more on creativity rather than repetitive tasks.

Throughout the setup, Copilot provided helpful suggestions for HTML structure, JavaScript logic, 
and even shell scripts for deployment. Its integration with Visual Studio Code made it easy to 
generate code snippets, refactor existing code, and explore new technologies with confidence.

If you‚Äôre interested in accelerating your own coding projects, I highly recommend checking out GitHub Copilot.
